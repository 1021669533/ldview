Missing features from QT version (implemented on Win32 version)
- command line parameters
- customized File Save dialog for series of pictures and image size
- offscreen rendering
- dropdown buttons on toolbar

QT4 know bugs
- OpenGL is not initialized/updated correctly, the models are not displayed at most of time
- icons for menu items and toolbars are not displayed
- submenus are not displayed

QT4 migration
- when QT4 will be wildly used (part of major linux distributions), the code must be migrated to native QT4 from Qt3Support class. At that time, the code will not support QT3.

- dropdown buttons on toolbar

QT4 know bugs
- repaint problem during model loading (paintEvent) bug ID 79310
- icons for menu items and toolbars are not displayed (bug reported to Trollech: bug ID 79286)
- toggle buttons on toolbar not work (toggle signal is not received, bug reported to Trolltech)

QT4 migration
- when QT4 will be wildly used (part of major linux distributions), the code must be migrated to native QT4 from Qt3Support class. At that time, the code will not support QT3.

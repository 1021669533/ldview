<TD COLSPAN="2">
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additions</B><BR/>
<UL>
<LI>New Cocoa-based LDView for the Mac.</LI>
<LI>Added basic support for steps.</LI>
<LI>Added export feature to convert LDraw files into other file formats.
Currently POV-Ray and Stereo Lithography file formats are supported.</LI>
<LI>Added Model Tree dialog (drawer in Cocoa version) to show a tree with all
the data from the model.</LI>
<LI>Added MPD model selection to show sub-models inside MPD models.</LI>
<LI>Added new latitude/longitude rotation mode.</LI>
<LI>Added dialog to set the latitude/longitude.  (This does not require you to
be in the new latitude/longitude rotation mode.)</LI>
<LI>Added support for multiple processors, and multi-core processors.
Transparency sorting and conditional line calculations now happen in background
threads when LDView is run on a computer with more than one processor core.</LI>
<LI>Added option to show the coordinate axes for the model, originating at the
model's origin.</LI>
<LI>Added support for JPEG snapshots.  The default JPEG settings are set using
rarely-used JPEG compression options that result in much better quality for
computer-generated imagery than is typically achieved with image tools.
(Specifically, LDView uses the 4:4:4 JPEG color sub-sampling by default.)</LI>
<LI>Added Bounding Box dialog that shows the minimum and maximum coordinates of
the bounding box for the model, and draws that bounding box.</LI>
<LI>Added view mode that only shows part bounding boxes.</LI>
<LI>Added support for rotation in examine mode with the arrow keys on the
keyboard.</LI>
<LI>Added steps to m6459.ldr sample model.</LI>
<LI>Added -SaveSnapshots command line option to allow multiple snapshots to be
saved at once from the command line.</LI>
<LI>Added "Transparent background" and "Auto-crop" to the snapshot saving UI.
(Previously, these options were only available via manual registry entries or
command line parameters.)</LI>
<LI>Added ability to set the 3D portion of the LDView window to various sizes
with standard aspect ratios.</LI>
<LI>Added ability to use the current LDView aspect ratio in the POV-Ray camera
info command.</LI>
<LI>Added ability to control the default directory where snapshots and part
lists get saved.  Choices are in the model directory, the most recently used
directory for the given file type, or a specified directory.</LI>
<LI>Added support for Black_Edge color definition.  Add a color to your
ldconfig.ldr with Black_Edge as its color name (case doesn't matter), and
LDView will use the given color for its black edge lines (assuming that
"Process ldconfig.ldr is checked in the general prefs.)</LI>
<LI>Added icons from toolbar to corresponding menu items when running in Windows
Vista.</LI>
</UL>
<BR/>
<B>Updates</B><BR/>
<UL>
<LI>Decreased the amount of time needed to make certain preference changes (for
example, toggling edge lines).</LI>
<LI>Greatly improved the output quality of "Transparent background" snapshots
when antialiased lines are enabled.</LI>
<LI>Changed snapshot rendering in Windows to do software rendering directly to
an in-memory bitmap when the Pixel Buffer OpenGL extension is unavailable or
disabled.  Previously, it rendered into the window, which caused a window to
appear for command line snapshot renders.</LI>
<LI>Changed the default setting for conditional lines from off to on.  Note that
since edge lines default to off, this won't be seen until the first time edge
lines are enabled.</LI>
<LI>Changed the default setting for seams to on.</LI>
<LI>Rotated 8464.mpd sample model 180 degrees so that it faces forward in the
default viewing angle.</LI>
<LI>Updated the toolbar to have smaller buttons in Windows XP and Windows
Vista.</LI>
<LI>Changed "Always black" edges to be truly black, instead of whatever color
was assigned to color code 0.</LI>
<LI>Updated "Always black" edges to use gray when used on dark colors, isntead
of black.</LI>
</UL>
<B>Bug Fixes</B>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed Windows version so that switching to full screen doesn't trigger a
full model reload.</LI>
<LI>Fixed handling of shift key when moving via the keyboard in fly-through
mode.</LI>
<LI>Fixed check boxes in group box titles in preferences to only show underlines
under mnemonic characters when appropriate when running with themes
enabled.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug where mouse control got messed up badly if you used
&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Tab&gt; to switch to another program while dragging with the
mouse in LDView.</LI>
<LI>Don't show model load failure error message if the user cancels the model
load.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug that sometimes caused a vertical line to appear on the left edge
of large snapshots.</LI>
<LI>Fixed handling of transparent and invisible LDLite color codes.</LI>
<LI>Fixed Errors &amp; Warnings Dialog on Windows verison to show the proper
error and warning counts when the dialog isn't shown automatically.</LI>
<LI>Fixed lock up when "Show View Info" was selected in Windows while themodel
was spinning.</LI>
<LI>Diable Open Model toolbar button during load.  Using it would result in a
crash.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug where hitting escape during load didn't work in Windows Vista
(and maybe other versions of Windows also).</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug where changing to a new LDraw directory would still give you a
message that the LDraw directory could not be found.</LI>
<LI>Fixed primitive substitution to work with primitives in the Unofficial/p
directory.</LI>
<LI>Fixed primitive substitution for 3-8ndis primitive.</LI>
<LI>Fixed fly-through speed to be dependent of FPS, so that having a super
high FPS doesn't produce super fast fly-through.</LI>
<LI>Fixed primitive substitution to work better with curve smoothing with
cone, sphere, and torus primitives.</LI>
<LI>Fixed problem with condtional lines showing up when they weren't supposed to
when their control points went outside of the view frustum.</LI>

(20 Aug, 2007)
</TD>
<TD COLSPAN="2">
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additions</B><BR/>
<UL>
<LI>Added ability to generate an HTML parts list of your model.</LI>
<LI>Added ability to set the direction that the light source points, both with
predefined light directions in the Preferences Dialog, and by holding down
Shift and dragging with the mouse.</LI>
<LI>Added support for light.dat files in LDraw models.  Unless disabled, these
will generate point light sources in the scene, up to a total of 8 lights.</LI>
<LI>Added ability to use LDView to generate thumbnails of .ldr and .mpd files in
Windows Explorer and Gnome Nautilus.</LI>
<LI>Made it so dragging with the middle mouse button pans (in addition to
the existing dragging with the left mouse button while holding down
Control).</LI>
<LI>Added support for anisotropic filtering on video cards that support it.</LI>
<LI>Added scroll wheel support to QT version.</LI>
<LI>Added BFC toolbar button to QT version.</LI>
<LI>Added support for the new !ldraw_org meta-statement to be used in the next
official parts release.</LI>
</UL>
<BR/>
<B>Updates</B><BR/>
<UL>
<LI>Made it so that settings specified on the command line don't get saved as if
they had been specified in the UI.  (For example, -WindowWidth=320 on the
command line would result in LDView launching with a window width of 320 the
next time it was run.)</LI>
<LI>Updated Zoom to Fit command so that the model remaines auto-centered after
using it.</LI>
<LI>Moved Errors &amp; Warnings, Show View Info, and Show POV-Ray Camera Info to
a new Tools menu.</LI>
<LI>Made it so only the main row of an error entry is bold.  Sub-rows are now
non-bold.</LI>
<LI>Made it so that transparency values of 240 and above are considered opaque.
This was done to get rid of ugly artifacts that show up on the glow-in-the-dark
color, which has a transparency value of 250.</LI>
</UL>
<B>Bug Fixes</B>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed bug in error reporting that would lead to a crash when the model file
has a really long line.</LI>
<LI>Fixed command line processing of -SaveSnapshot so that it doesn't generate a
blank snapshot.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug that caused the LDView screensaver to crash when you tried to
bring up its settings.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug where some models would be clipped after a Zoom to Fit.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug where the Errors &amp; Warnings window would sporadically not draw
correctly after being resized.</LI>
<LI>Fixed cutaway wireframe causing one entire eye image to be drawn in
wireframe when stereo is enabled.</LI>
<LI>Fixed tiled snapshot saves to not ignore the SaveAlpha setting.</LI>
<LI>Fixed -cg option to support the optional radius portion.</LI>
<LI>Fixed tiled snapshot saves when PBuffer isn't available to make the image
size an even multiple of the number of tiles used.  It already did this with
PBuffer snapshots.  With non-PBuffer snapshots, you ended up with a border
(usually black) on the top and right sides of the image.</LI>
<LI>Fixed display glitch in Windows versions when switching the viewing angle
via the toolbar.  Switching the viewing angle via the main menu still has the
display glitch.</LI>
<LI>Fixed command line snapshot saves to pay attention to the file extension of
the snapshot file specified on the command line, instead of using the
SaveImageType setting.</LI>
<LI>Fixed crash when LDView encounters two LDraw files that refer to each other.
It now generates an error and skips the child model's reference to its
ancestor model.</LI>

LDView.</LI>
</UL>
<BR/>
<B>Updates</B><BR/>
<UL>
<LI>Updated <I>m6459.ldr</I> sample model to no longer contain renamed
parts.</LI>
<LI>Updated generation of new triangles and lines from quads and triangles that
contain identical or co-linear vertices to use the original text from the file
to generate the new primitives, instead of using text generated based on
rounding of the numbers.</LI>
<LI>Updated the warning messages generated in the above case to also use the
text from the file, instead of rounding the numbers.</LI>
<LI>Renamed the Error window to <I>Errors &amp; Warnings</I>.</LI>
<LI>Updated Windows version to disable more menu items when there's no model
loaded.</LI>
</UL>
<B>Bug Fixes</B>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed handling of 12-bit dithered transparent direct colors.</LI>
<LI>Fixed crash that occurred when one of the numeric parameters was missing
from a line-type 1 line that referenced a filename that began with a number
(such as a part).</LI>
<LI>Fixed LDView so that it gives you an error if you select a file from the
recent files list, and the file no longer exists.</LI>

(13 Dec, 2005)
</TD>
<TD COLSPAN="2">
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additions</B><BR/>
<UL>
<LI>Completely new rendering engine, written from scratch.  This allows for
the following enhancements that would have been very difficult before:
<UL>
<LI>Significantly reduced memory usage on large models.  Measured reduction on
Orion Pobursky's Imperial Star Destroyer model with all settings set to default:
86%.  The same, but with LDView 3's <I>Memory usage</I> setting set to Low: 90%.
(Note that these are <I>reductions</I> of and 86% and 90%, respectively, meaning
LDView 3 requires 16% the memory LDView 2.1.01 requires on that model with
default settings.)</LI>
<LI>Significantly reduced load time on large models.</LI>
<LI>BFC (Back Face Culling) support.</LI>
<LI>BFC verification support (red back faces and/or green front faces).</LI>
<LI>Potentially faster rendering.  (Actual speed differences vary significantly
based on video hardware and what settings are set.)</LI>
<!--<LI>Support for steps (not implemented yet, but coming).</LI>-->
</UL></LI>
<LI>Added a toolbar (which can of course be disabled if desired).</LI>
<LI>Added support for translation DLLs.</LI>
<LI>Added a distinction between errors and warnings.</LI>
<LI>Added detection of more problems and potential problems with model files,
leading to more errors and warnings.</LI>
<LI>Added support for making the default color transparent.  (Primarily useful
for part authors.)</LI>
<LI>Added direct access to the help file to the Linux version.</LI>
<LI>Added primitive substitution support for full-circle versions of new torus
primitives.</LI>
<LI>Added primitive substitution support for chord primitives.</LI>
<LI>Added context-sensitive help to the save snapshot dialog.</LI>
<LI>Added workaround for snapshot corruption that was happening on some video
cards (<I>Don't use Pixel Buffer</I> option during snapshot save).</LI>
<LI>Added Memory usage option to allow LDView to conserve even more memory.
(This comes at the possible expense of speed.  However, if you're swapping when
the <I>Memory usage</I> setting is set to High, and not swapping when it's set
to Low, then Low will be faster.)</LI>
<LI>Added support for LDraw search directory list in ldraw.ini using Lars
 Hassing's LDrawIni code.</LI>
<LI>Added support for spaces in submodel filenames.  (Generates a warning.)</LI>
<LI>Added extra command line parsing for use when using LDView as a renderer
from LPub.</LI>
<LI>Added detection of primitive comment so that primitive detection can work on
primitives outside the ldraw\p directory.</LI>
<LI>Added support for automatic cropping of images (via the command line only;
no UI at this time.</LI>
<LI>Added new sample model created by Peter Bartfai: 8464.mpd.</LI>
</UL>
<BR/>
<B>Updates</B><BR/>
<UL>
<LI>Rearranged items in the File menu.</LI>
<LI>Revamped error dialog box.</LI>
<LI>Removed the recompile requirement for P-Buffer snapshots.</LI>
<LI>Updated primitive substitution support to also substitute primitives in the
p/48 directory.</LI>
<LI>Updated text of check buttons in group box titles of preferences to match
the color of other group box titles when run in Windows XP with themes
enabled.</LI>
<LI>Improved sorting of transparent substituted primitives.</LI>
<LI>Updated color handling to match LDraw's behavior for unknown colors.</LI>

<B>Bug Fixes</B>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed transparent extended colors so they work.</LI>
<LI>Fixed snapshot saving to always redraw the model after the snapshot
save.</LI>
<LI>Fixed maximum depth of cutaway mode.</LI>
<LI>Fixed default zoom for tall windows.</LI>
<LI>Fixed zoom-to-fit with wide edge lines and wide wireframe lines.</LI>
<LI>Fixed panning to be usable over the entire supported field-of-view
range.</LI>
<LI>Fixed problem in OpenGL driver information dialog that would cause a crash
on some video cards.</LI>
<LI>Fixed problem that caused the delete button not to be enabled after a single
directory was added to the extra search directories list.</LI>
<LI>Fixed smoothing to not smooth across sharp angles.</LI>
<LI>Fixed auto-calculated extension for BMP snapshots when the save snapshot
series option wasn't enabled.</LI>
<LI>Fixed zooming with the mouse wheel.</LI>
<LI>Fixed seams to not double-shrink parts that are referenced from other
parts.</LI>
<LI>Fixed clipping problem that sometimes showed up in fly-through mode.</LI>
<LI>Fixed command line parsing problem that could cause LDView to crash.</LI>
<LI>Fixed command line parsing problem that could cause LDView to incorrectly
miss an LDraw file specified on the command line.</LI>
<LI>Fixed problem that caused subfiles in an MPD file with a backslash (\) in
their filename not to load.</LI>
<LI>Fixed problem that prevented screensaver settings from sticking when a
preference set was selected in the screensaver.</LI>
<LI>Fixed problem that prevented status bar from being visible when LDView was
started up maximized.</LI>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additions</B>
</TD>
<TD><UL>
<LI>Re-introduced co-linear point detection in quads.  I discovered that my
previous belief that there was a legitimate use for them was flawed.</LI>
<LI>Added ability to the screen saver to have it randomly choose a preference
set each time it runs.  It should be noted that the preference set
includes the screen saver file or directory selection, so you can have
individual models display with particular settings if you want.</LI>
<LI>Added support for snapshots up to 9999x9999 on any video card by using
tiling to construct images bigger than would otherwise be supported.</LI>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additions</B>
</TD>
<TD><UL>
<LI>Added Zoom to Fit command, as well as Zoom to Fit option during snapshot
saving.  This uses the auto camera positioning algorithm from L3P (which was
graciously provided to me by Lars Hassing).</LI>
<LI>Added ability to remove hidden lines from wireframe mode.</LI>
<LI>Added ability to change the default viewing angle, and added the ability to
get to the original isometric viewing angle if you change the default one.</LI>
<LI>Added ability to specify a view matrix on the command line.</LI>
<LI>Added ability to specify the camera's latitude and longitude on the
command line (similar to L3P's -cg command line option).</LI>
<LI>Added ability to modify the default zoom level on the command line.</LI>
<LI>Added menu command to show information about the current view and copy it
to the clipboard in a format suitable for use on the command line.</LI>
<LI>Added ability to control the field of view.</LI>
<LI>Added documentation for the -SaveSnapshot command line option.</LI>
<LI>Added support for ldconfig.ldr.</LI>
<LI>Added support for custom colors inside model files (as well as inside
ldconfig.ldr) using the 0 COLOR meta-command.</LI>
<LI>Added ability to specify extra part/sub-model search directories.</LI>
<LI>Added an optional work-around for a problem that sometimes prevented
Windows 98 systems from going into power save mode when LDView was used as a

<B>Updates</B>
</TD>
<TD><UL>
<LI>Updated fly controls to deal with FOV changes.  They won't work quite as
well at extreme FOV settings, but they should still be usable.</LI>
<LI>Removed Default from Viewing Angles menu.  It was redundant, since it did
the same thing as the Reset View command, and likely more confusing than
useful.</LI>
<LI>Improved transparent shape sorting performance.</LI>
</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">
<B>Bug Fixes</B>
</TD>
<TD><UL>
<LI>Fixed precision in error window to prevent excessive rounding of the
displayed values (note that the actual values were never rounded).</LI>
<LI>Added missing documentation for HiResPrimitives registry/command line
setting.</LI>
<LI>Added code to prevent multiple copies of the LDView screen saver from
running simultaneously.  This shouldn't be necessary, but since I received a
report in Windows 98SE indicating about 50 copies of the LDView screen saver, it
is obviously useful as a safety measure.</LI>
<LI>Added code to allow power save mode to work in Windows 98 when using LDView
as a screen saver.  As with the multiple copies problem, this shouldn't be
necessary, but it appears to be (at least on some systems).</LI>
<LI>Fixed -SaveSnapshot to handle relative paths correctly for the image
filename.</LI>
<LI>Fixed -SaveAlpha to work again.  It was broken at some point.</LI>
<LI>Fixed the Reset functionality of each preference page to work properly.</LI>
<LI>Fixed status bar to continue to correctly display the FPS after you switch
FSAA modes.</LI>
<LI>Removed detection and handling of co-linear points in quads.  There is
a legitimate reason to have a quad that degenerates into a triangle; it can
prevent seams from being visible in certain circumstances.</LI>
<LI>Fixed SaveSnapshot so that it now only loads the model once; previously it
would load it and then immediately reload it, doubling the load time.</LI>
<LI>Fixed default camera zoom level to be the correct value, instead of a loose
approximation that occasionally resulted in clipping.</LI>
<LI>Fixed FOV calculation when the window is taller than it is wide.</LI>
<LI>Fixed command line parsing to properly handle quotes around a filename
specified as part of an option.</LI>
<LI>Fixed jerkiness in fly-through mode after setting preferences.</LI>
<LI>Fixed screen saver so it correctly automatically finds the LDView help file
when you use context help (as long as LDView has been run at least once from its
installed directory.</LI>
<LI>Fixed screen saver so that when you hit the Reset button on the Screen
Saver settings tab, the Apply button is enabled.</LI>

<TD><UL>
<LI>Added ability to have LDView draw just edge lines, with hidden line removal
by default, or no hidden line removal when in wireframe mode.</LI>
<LI>Added ShowAllType5 and ShowType5ControlPoints settings to the Preferences
panel so that they can be changed from inside LDView.  (Before, you had to
either specify them on the command line or modify the registry.)</LI>
<LI>Added support for hi-res (48-sided) primitives.  This only currently has
an effect when primitive substitution is disabled, since all of the current
hi-res primitives are supported by primitive substitution.</LI>

<B>Updates</B>
</TD>
<TD><UL>
<LI>Updated "new" torus primitive substitution to treat size fractions of nnnn
to be n / 9, instead of nnnn / 10000.  This means that 3333 correctly gets
interpreted as 1/3.</LI>
<LI>Sped up curve smoothing (significantly, in certain situations).</LI>
<LI>Updated recent file tracking to not include files with a ".tmp" extension.
This was done primarily to prevent LDraw Design Pad temp files from cluttering
up the recent files list.  It seems safe to assume that if a file has a ".tmp"
extension, it's a temporary file, and shouldn't go in the recent files
list.</LI>

that contained repeat copies of a subfile.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug that the model didn't draw completely correctly if loaded in
wireframe mode and then switched to display in non-wireframe mode.
Unfortunately, the fix requires reloading the model when switching wireframe
mode on and off.</LI>
<LI>Fixed default custom colors in the color chooser to work in Windows XP.  It
wasn't working at all before (and may have been broken in Windows NT/2000 as
well).</LI>
<LI>Fixed screen saver browse file button to include .ldr files in the default

<LI>Created a version using QT.  This was developed in Linux, but should work in
any Unix-like operating system with OpenGL and QT support and a 32-bit compiler.
(I can almost guarantee it won't work if compiled with a 64-bit compiler.)
RedHat 7.3-compatible Linux binaries available for download.</LI>
<LI>Added a status bar (which can be hidden).</LI>

color to try to better convey their metallic nature.  They still aren't
reflective, but they are now more shiny.</LI>
<LI>Added support for BaseDirectory setting in [LDraw] section of
ldraw.ini.</LI>
<LI>Added a menu item to allow you to manually change the LDraw directory once
it has been chosen for the first time.  This is only useful when the old
directory still exists, because LDView checks for it every time it runs and
automatically prompts you if it goes away.</LI>

Canceling a load can now be accomplished either by hitting escape or selecting
the <I>Cancel Load</I> item on the file menu.  Even when the status bar is set
to be hidden, it is shown during image loads to show progress.  Hopefully this
change will remove the image load problems that showed up to varying extents on
varying hardware (particularly for those people who had no problems in LDView
version 1.0).</LI>
<LI>Updated to display FPS in the status bar if the status bar is visible and
FPS are set to be displayed in the preferences.  FPS is displayed as before
when the status bar is not visible (including in full-screen mode).</LI>

<LI>Fixed bug that made it so that changing the specular preference had no
effect if <I>Alternate lighting</I> was checked.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug that caused in-frame FPS text to be drawn half its normal width
when stereo viewing was enabled.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug that caused the field of view to be greater than 180 degrees with
a really tall skinny window (thus inverting the model).  If your screen
resolution was 1600x1200 or lower, you had to be in stereo mode in order to
witness this bug.</LI>
<LI>Fixed field of view calculation for tall skinny windows to come closer to
preserving the model's scale (instead of shrinking the model down to
nothing).  This fix probably removes the need for the field of view cap fix
above, but it was done separately.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug that caused wireframe cutaway in tall skinny windows to draw the

<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">
<B>Updates</B>
</TD>
<TD><UL>
<LI>Moved the Help menu back over with the other menu items to be consistent
with other Windows apps.</LI>
<LI>Changed it so that it displays a directory tree if it cannot determine your
LDraw directory (instead of forcing you to type in the path).</LI>
<LI>Converted the README.TXT file to HTML and renamed it to Help.html.  In
addition to the conversion to HTML and enhancements in formatting, I also
improved the content somewhat.</LI>

<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">
<B>Bug fixes</B>
</TD>
<TD><UL>
<LI>Fixed the frame rate calculation to be more accurate.</LI>
<LI>Fixed zoom speed to be consistent across models of different sizes.</LI>
<LI>Fixed startup code to correctly maximize the window if it was maximized when
you last exited.  This worked at one point, but became broken.</LI>
<LI>Fixed it to search the MODELS subdirectory of the LDRAW directory when
looking for a part.</LI>
<LI>Fixed it so that when fullscreen mode fails, it switches back to windowed
mode gracefully after presenting the error panel (instead of waiting for you to
switch back manually, then crashing without restoring the video mode).</LI>

0.9<BR/>
(25 Sep, 2000)
</TD>
<TD ALIGN="RIGHT">
<B>Additions</B>
</TD>
<TD><UL>
<LI>Added sphere primitive substitution.  This was--<B>by far</B>--the hardest
primitive substitution.  Unlike the other primitive substitutions, the sphere
primitive substitution results in a different set of polygons being drawn.  The
sphere that LDView creates is made up of 16 triangles, unlike the standard
sphere primitive, which is made up of 9 quads and 4 triangles.</LI>
<LI>Added support for black rubber (color 256).  I made it <B>significantly</B>
less shiny when specular lighting is enabled.  (There is no visual difference
when specular lighting is disabled.)</LI>
<LI>Added support for stipple transparency.</LI>
</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">
<B>Updates</B>
</TD>
<TD><UL>
<LI>Changed it so only the OpenGL window has a private device context.  This is
much more in keeping with standard Win32 programming guidelines.</LI>
</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">
<B>Bug fixes</B>
</TD>
<TD><UL>
<LI>Fixed NT bug where the video mode list would have a bunch of repeats for
each resolution (one for each refresh rate at that resolution, I think).</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug where background color button would not show the currently
selected color if you used Ctrl+Shift+P to bring up the preferences panel for
the first time.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug where concave polygons with non-winding points would cause a
crash.  I definitely fixed the crash; I think I fixed it so that they will
actually draw correctly as well.</LI>
<LI>Fixed possible bug in substituted primitive color setting.  I never saw the
problem exhibit itself, but the code seemed wrong.</LI>

0.7.5<BR/>
(08-Sep, 2000)
</TD>
<TD ALIGN="RIGHT">
<B>Additions</B>
</TD>
<TD><UL>
<LI>Added primitive substitution option.  This produces higher quality output,
as well as slightly enhanced performance.  I have created substitutions for the
following primitives:
<UL>
<LI>Low-res Studs (Standard Studs are made up of other primitives.)</LI>
<LI>Cylinders</LI>
<LI>Sloped Cylinders</LI>
<LI>Torus</LI>
<LI>Cones</LI>
<LI>Disks (no visual difference)</LI>
<LI>Rings (no visual difference)</LI>
<LI>Edges (no visual difference)</LI>
</UL></LI>
<LI>Added support for concave quads (it now splits them into two
triangles).</LI>
</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">
<B>Updates</B>
</TD>
<TD><UL>
<LI>Optimized model-loading to decrease load time somewhat (only really
noticeable on really large models).</LI>
<LI>Updated Open Panel to be owned by main window.  This was required to allow
it to work in fullscreen mode.</LI>
</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">
<B>Bug fixes</B>
</TD>
<TD><UL>
<LI>Fixed command line file opening to switch to the directory containing the
model so that if it references other sub-models it will still work.</LI>
<LI>Fixed drag and drop to change to the dropped file's directory so that models
with subparts will work.</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug in which color wasn't initialized properly always, resulting in
incorrect colors sometimes.</LI>
<LI>Fixed keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+O, Ctrl+Q, Ctrl+Shift+P, etc).  Although I
believe they worked when I originally added them, they have been broken for
awhile now.  Note that these work while in fullscreen mode on some video cards,
so you can now change options and open a new file without having to switch back
to windowed mode (assuming you remember Ctrl+O and Ctrl+Shift+P).</LI>

reorganized my registry settings.
